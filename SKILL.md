# Solana Agent Wallet

Agent-scoped Solana wallets: one logical agent = one keypair (stored encrypted) and a configurable max spend (SOL). The AI agent is the only interface; it calls tools that read balance, transfer, airdrop, or swap.

## Tool contracts (implement these as OpenClaw tools or HTTP endpoints)

All tools that move funds or create agents must enforce **max_spend** (SOL) and **confirmation** in the agent flow.

| Tool | Purpose | Parameters | Security |
|------|---------|------------|----------|
| `create_agent` | Create agent + wallet in one step | `maxSpend` (number, SOL) | Persist encrypted keys; set agent.max_spend |
| `create_wallet` | Attach a new wallet to existing agent | — | Overwrites previous wallet for that agent |
| `get_balance` | SOL balance for current agent | — | Read-only |
| `get_wallet_address` | Public key for current agent | — | Read-only |
| `transfer_sol` | Send SOL to address | `recipientAddress`, `amount` (SOL) | Enforce amount ≤ max_spend; simulate before send |
| `request_airdrop` | Devnet airdrop | `amount` (optional, SOL, default 0.5, max 2) | Rate-limited by RPC |
| `get_assets_by_owner` | Fungible tokens for an address (Helius) | `ownerAddress`, `page`, `limit` | Read-only; needs HELIUS_API_KEY |
| `buy_token` | Buy SPL token with SOL via Jupiter | `mintAddress`, `amountSol` (optional) | Enforce amountSol ≤ max_spend; needs JUPITER_API_KEY |

## Security rules for implementation

- **Encryption**: Store per-agent `encrypted_private_key` (AEK-encrypted) and `encrypted_agent_key` (MASTER_KEY-encrypted AEK). Decrypt only in memory when signing; never log or expose raw keys.
- **Spend cap**: Before any `transfer_sol` or `buy_token`, check `amount <= agent.max_spend` (in SOL). Reject and return a clear message if over.
- **Simulation**: For Solana transfers, run `simulateTransaction` before `sendRawTransaction`; abort send if simulation fails.
- **Context**: All state-changing tools require a current **agentId** (from session or user selection). Read-only tools may accept an optional address.

## How the agent should behave

- Confirm transaction details (recipient, amount) with the user before calling `transfer_sol` or `buy_token`. On explicit confirmation (“yes”, “go ahead”, “confirm”), call the tool immediately.
- Always respect `max_spend`; if the user asks to send more than the limit, explain the limit and refuse.
- For token buys: use `get_assets_by_owner` to list tokens for an address, then call `buy_token` per mint with a sensible `amountSol` (e.g. 0.1) within `max_spend`.

## Environment / config

- `MASTER_KEY`: 32-byte hex; required to decrypt agent keys for signing.
- `SOLANA_RPC`: Optional; devnet/mainnet URL.
- `HELIUS_API_KEY`: For `get_assets_by_owner`.
- `JUPITER_API_KEY`: For `buy_token`.

Use these as gating in OpenClaw (`metadata.openclaw.requires.env`) so the skill is only loaded when the wallet backend is configured.
